# Svelte High Priority - To Do App

This is a simple To Do application built with Svelte for a school assignment.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

npm install

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

npm run dev

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

npm run build

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Using TypeScript

This template comes with a script to set up a TypeScript development environment, you can run it immediately after cloning the template with:

node scripts/setupTypeScript.js

Or remove the script via:

rm scripts/setupTypeScript.js
